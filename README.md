## System Architecture

### Backend Architecture

Equilibrium uses a microservices approach, with each backend service isolated in a Docker container. This approach simplifies development, testing, and deployment of each service independently. Google Cloud Run allows the containers to run in the cloud without managing server infrastructure, ensuring optimal resource usage and consistent performance.

### Frontend Architecture

Vercel provides a fast and efficient deployment platform for frontend applications, with features like automatic scaling, caching, and performance optimization. The frontend communicates with the backend through well-defined APIs, ensuring quick and secure data access. The Jamstack architecture separates the frontend from the backend, allowing faster development and secure, scalable deployments.
